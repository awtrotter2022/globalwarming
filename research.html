<strong>Evidence for Yes</strong>
<br><br>
Due to the rapid increase in pollutants and heat currently being released into the environment by humans,
many scientists believe that the earth is being negatively affected. One piece of evidence to support the
theory of global warming is the increased atmospheric carbon dioxide 


levels recently recorded. The table on
the right shows how the levels of atmospheric carbon changed very little between 1800 and 1850, but shot up
drastically in the much shorter timeframe between 2000 and 2018. While the level of carbon dioxide only
increased 2 ppm (parts per million) between 1800 and 1850, it increased by about 30 ppm between 2000 and 2018.
An increase in atmospheric carbon is harmful to the planet because carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, meaning
that it traps heat in the atmosphere, and prevents it from being released back into space.
<br><br>
In addition to increased carbon levels, another piece of evidence that supports the global warming theory
is the continuous high temperatures being recorded. The five warmest years ever recorded have all taken place                 
during the past eight years. Additionally, the earth's average temperature has risen 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit
since the 19th century. This rapid rise in global temperature is very unusual, and only began to occur
when human activity began to impact the environment.
<br><br>
Finally, global warming can be proven by the shrinking ice sheets in the North and South poles. The ice sheets
covering Greenland lost about 281 billion tons of ice in the last 25 years, and Antarctica's ice mass decreased
about 119 billion tons in 25 years. This amount of ice being lost is very abnormal, and is very likely to be
caused by global warming due to human activity. The rate for the loss of ice in Antarctica has tripled during the
past ten years, likely due to the increased levels of carbon dioxide and high global temperatures being recorded
each year.

<strong>Evidence for No</strong>
<br><br>
Although there is a large amount of strong evidence to support the fact that global warming
is an important issue, many scientists disagree. One reason for this is that the earth naturally
goes through very warm and very cold phases. Many believe that the high temperatures being recently
recorded are due to a warming phase following the last ice age, and not due to human activity affecting
the planet's climate.
<br><br>
Another piece of evidence to support the theory that global warming is not an important issue is that
the sea level has been rising naturally for thousands of years, before humans were able to affect the environment.
The sea levels on Earth were predicted to be about 400 feet lower than they are today shortly after the end of
the latest ice age. Although many scientists use the fact of rising sea levels to support the reality of global
warming, others say that human activity has not caused this change.
<br><br>
Finally, many people believe that global warming is not caused by human activity because of the ocean currents
that could be melting the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets, rather than global warming. Throughout the 20th century,
multiple warming phases have been recorded in the Arctic, with a cooler phase occurring after each. This is thought to
be the result of deep ocean currents carrying warm water to the North and South poles. The warm and cold phases 
experienced in the Arctic and Antarctic correlate closely with weather patterns in the ocean, leading many scientists to
believe that human activity has not directly influenced the melting of ice sheets.

<strong>My Opinion:</strong>
<br>
In my opinion, global warming is an important issue because there is a large amount of evidence to support the fact
that the earth is getting warmer at a rapid pace. The evidence that has been observed, such as increased carbon dioxide
levels and increased temperatures, show that global warming is affecting the planet due to human activity and pollutants
produced by industrialization.
